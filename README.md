# BRITEN Official Website
This is the official website for BRiTEN I have built using the NuxtJS framework. The reason I chose the move from a traditional website, is that I needed to make the website an SPA; to give it a modern look and feel. As of now, the website is typically a site, and not an application as there are no server side operations in the website.

## Version 1 Udate
I did not use the version naming convention when I was developing this website, so right now I will consider the current website to be Version 1.0

I am about to carry out version 1 update to version 1.0.1, which will mainly deal with two main things:
[] Add media page to the website
[] Update the projects page
[] Update the staff bio page
[] Add social media links to the website


## Version 2 Update
The website is right now still in version one (v 1) and it has  been for a while. What version 2 requires, is a way to convert the website into a web application. The two main things I wish to implement in the version 2 (v 2) of the website are:
1.  Allow user feedback; collect visitors comments from the "Contact Us" page
2.  Create a mini-CMS to allow for 
  * Blogging
  * File Uploading

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
